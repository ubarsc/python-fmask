WARNING: To install python-fmask it is strongly  recommended to use the conda forge
pre-built binaries. Only install from source if you absolutely must.


To install python-fmask from the source code bundle, use the following commands

First unpack the bundle. For the tar.gz file, this would be 
    tar xfz python-fmask-0.4.2.tar.gz
For the zip file this would be
    unzip -q python-fmask-0.4.2.zip

The installation uses setuptools packaging. This is best driven by pip
(direct use of setup.py is now deprecated by the setuptools people), so 
the following commands are fairly standard. 

Build the code
    cd python-fmask-0.4.2
    pip install .


If you wish to install in a non-default location, use
    pip install . --prefix=/yourChosenDirectory

If installed in a non-default location, you will then need to ensure that the 
right environment variables are set. For simple bash syntax, this would be 
something like:
    export PATH="/yourChosenDirectory/bin:$PATH"
    export PYTHONPATH="/yourChosenDirectory/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

Note that the pythonX.X sub-directory needs to match your version of python.
