Functions relating to estimating the per-pixel sun and satellite angles for 
a given Landsat image. These are rough estimates, using the generic
characteristics of the Landsat 5 platform, and are not particularly accurate,
but good enough for the current purposes. 

Historically, the USGS have not supplied satellite zenith/azimuth angles, and have only 
supplied scene-centre values for sun zenith/azimuth angles. Since the satellite
view geometry is important in correctly tracking a shadow when matching shadows
to their respective clouds, the Fmask algorithm requires good estimates of all these
angles. The routines contained here are used to derive per-pixel estimates of 
these angles. 

As of mid-2016, the USGS are planning to supply sufficient information to calculate
these angles directly from orbit ephemeris data. When that comes about, it seems likely
that the need for the routines here will diminish, but any data downloaded from USGS
prior to then will still require this approach, as the associated angle metadata will 
not be present. 

The core Fmask code in this package is adaptable enough to be configured for either 
approach. 

The general approach for satellite angles is to estimate the nadir line by running it
down the middle of the image data area. The satellite azimuth is assumed to be
at right angles to this nadir line, which is only roughly correct. For the whisk-broom 
sensors on Landsat-5 and Landsat-7, this angle is not 90 degrees, but is affected by 
earth rotation and is latitude dependent. For Landsat-8, the scan line is at 
right angles, due to the compensation for earth rotation, but the push-broom is 
made up of sub-modules which point in slightly different directions, giving 
slightly different satellite azimuths along the scan line. None of these effects
are included in the current estimates. The satellite zenith is estimated based on the
nadir point, the scan-line, and the assumed satellite altitude, and includes the
appropriate allowance for earth curvature. 

Because this works by searching the imagery for the non-null area, and assumes that 
this represents a full-swath image, it would not work for a subset of a full image. 

The sun angles are approximated using the algorithm found in the Fortran code with
6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum). The subroutine
in question is the POSSOL() routine. I translated the Fortran code into Python for
inclusion here.
