Make a 4-layer image of satellite and sun angles, from the given tile metadata
file. 

The sun angles are exactly as provided in the XML. The satellite angles are more 
complicated, because they vary slightly with each band. I have done some limited 
testing and concluded that the variation is generally quite small, and so the 
layers written here are the per-pixel averages over all bands. The satellite
zenith this appears to vary only a couple of degrees across bands, while the 
variation for satellite azimuth is somewhat larger, depending on which bands. I
think that the 60m bands vary a bit more, but not sure. This is also complicated
by the variation across the scan, due to the different view angles of each detector
module. The pushbroom appears to be made up of 12 such modules, each looking
in slightly different directions, and each band within each module looking slightly
differently. Complicated...... sigh......

A bit of a description of how the instrument is structured can be found at
    https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument
