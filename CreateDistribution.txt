How to create a distribution of python-fmask. 

1. Ensure that you have pulled and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the fmask/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
3. Update the release notes page in the doco (doc/source/releasenotes.rst), 
   by going through the change logs since the last release, and noting 
   what has been done. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
4. Push the changes to github with "git push" and create a PR for it and merge it.
5. Check out a clean copy of the repository into /tmp or
   somewhere similar and 'cd' into it.
6. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python -m build
   This creates both a tar.gz and a wheel, under a subdirectory called dist
7. Create a checksum of the tar.gz, e.g.
       sha256sum python-fmask-0.5.9.tar.gz > python-fmask-0.5.9.tar.gz.sha256
8. Go to the https://github.com/ubarsc/python-fmask/releases page, and create a 
   new release by pressing "Draft a new release". 
   You should fill in the following:
       Tag version: pythonfmask-A.B.C
       Release Title: Version A.B.C
       Description: Add a brief description (a few lines at most) explaining
                    the key points about this release.
       Upload files: Add the tar.gz and zip files. 
       Click "Publish release"


Version Numbers.
The python-fmask version number is structured as A.B.C. We follow the conventions 
outlined in Semantic Versioning [https://semver.org]
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
